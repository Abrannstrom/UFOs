# UFOs
## Overview of Project
> Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

1. ***Deliverable 1***: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
2. ***Deliverable 2***: A written report on the UFO analysis. 

## Resources and Before Start Notes:

* Data Source: `ufo_starterCode.js` and `index.html`
* Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB
* Software: ES6+, ECMAScript, MongoDB, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.

2. **Results:** Let’s describe step by step how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria. Using images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
 
Let’s begin reviewing our HTML Filter and Table code.

From our Website (Project Example:) [`https://www.UFOs.gov`](https://abrannstrom.github.io/UFOs/).

Need to visit FILTER SEARCH 

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Images/W2.JPG?raw=true)

On filter criteria, you can search by "Shape" only if want, example: triangle

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Images/W3.JPG?raw=true)

And click on "Filter Table" button,

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Images/W4.JPG?raw=true)

Automatically your search criteria will appear in our dynamic table resource.  

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Images/W5.JPG?raw=true)

And, if want to start a new search, just click on "Clear Table" button, and start a new search.

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Images/W6.JPG?raw=true)

After clear table, you may see our default data,

3. **Summary:** In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.


> Drawback:

During the project we realized that we needed to publicly expose the information, so it was necessary to use GitHub Pages to bring everything in one place.

> Recommendations:


1. **GitHub Pages - Website Presentation**
Please use the following [`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com/), for more information on how to use IO pages. 

2. **Create a better `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` Work interaction that feed UFOs data from most concise and automate workload**

For our best data presentation and most concise introduction to UFO information, we highly recommend UFO summaries. These fact-filled summaries provide revealing UFO information from dozens of government, military, and intelligence witnesses with impeccable credentials, that involves M.D. and former ER director, Dr. Steven M. Greer, has compiled videotaped testimony of astronauts, generals, professors, and highly respected government officials who reveal their direct experiences in the UFO cover-up. 

Including live testimonies were transcribed and published in the highly revealing Data.
